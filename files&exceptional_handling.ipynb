        "Ans. A process pool is a collection of worker processes managed by a pool manager that allows you to execute tasks concurrently across multiple processes. Instead of creating and managing processes manually for each task, a process pool provides a higher-level abstraction for distributing work efficiently among a fixed number of processes.\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Handling exceptions in concurrent programs is crucial because concurrency introduces unique challenges, such as multiple tasks running independently, competing for resources, and interacting with shared data. Without proper exception handling, errors in one thread or process can propagate, cause resource leaks, or leave the system in an inconsistent state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Exception Handling is Crucial in Concurrent Programs\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Preventing Resource Leaks:\n",
        "\n",
        "Threads or processes might acquire resources (e.g., file handles, locks, or memory) that need to be released even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unhandled exceptions may leave resources locked or unreleased.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Maintaining Consistency:\n",
        "\n",
        "Shared data structures or states can become corrupted if a thread or process encounters an exception during critical operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Ensuring System Stability:\n",
        "\n",
        "In systems with multiple tasks, an unhandled exception in one thread or process can cause the entire program to crash or hang.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Debugging and Monitoring:\n",
        "\n",
        "Proper exception handling ensures that errors are logged or propagated in a way that facilitates debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Swallowed exceptions can make it difficult to identify and resolve issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Graceful Degradation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Concurrent programs often involve critical and non-critical tasks. Handling exceptions allows non-critical tasks to fail without affecting critical ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Inter-Thread/Process Communication:\n",
        "\n",
        "In concurrent programs, exceptions in one task might need to be communicated to other tasks to handle dependencies properly.\n",
        "\n",
